this is test

once i fork your repo, i cloned that to my working directory:

dit clone https://gitub.com/user-name/forked-repository.git

once i commit changes i make, i push it to my origin:
git push origin 

but, i want to stay up to date with your newer tasks, 
so i make a connection with you (upstream repository):
git remote add upstream https://github.com/UOA-MEDSCI-736/sandbox.git

now that we are connected, i bring in the new task that you might create:
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
