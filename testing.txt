checkit out, Fab!
i want to submit my assignment to you

once i fork your repository, i clone that to my working directory:
git clone https://github.com/my-user-name/forked-repository.git

once i commit changes i make, i push it to my origin:
git push origin

but, i want to stay up to date with your newer tasks,
so i make a connection with you (upstream repository):
git remote upstream https://github.com/boss-user-name/original-repository.git

now that we're connected, i bring in the new task that you might create:
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
