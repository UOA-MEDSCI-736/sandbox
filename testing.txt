check it out, Fab!
i want to submit my assignments to you

Once I fork you repo, I clone that to my working directory:

git clone https://github.com/nbir012/forked-repo

once i commit changes I make, i push it to my origin:

git push origin

but I want to stay up to date with your newer tasks, so i make a connection
with you (upstream repository):

git remote upstream https://github.com/UOA-MEDSCI-736.git

now that we're connected, I bring in the new task that you create:

git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
