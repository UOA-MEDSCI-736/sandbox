check it out , Fab!
I want to submit my assignments to you

once I fork your repository, I clone that to my working directory:

git clone https://github.com/CallumChalmers29/forked-repository.git

Once I commit changes I make, I push it to my origin:

git push

But I want to stay up date with your newer tasks, so I make a connection with you (upstream repository)

git remote add upstream https://gihub.com/boss-username/original-respository.git

Now that we are connected, I bring in the new task that you might create

git fetch upstream

git merge upstream/master
